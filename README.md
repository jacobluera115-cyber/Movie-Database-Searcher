# Movie-Database-Searcher
coded and designed a Movie database searcher that allows you to both store and search movie details based on inputted details regarding actors, title, year, runtime, and director. When you find the movie you are looking for based on inputted details, an output is given that states the actors, title, year, runtime, and director.
I have attatched the CSC 20 FInal project.zip file that contains all the code for the database searcher.
